# Infix-to-RPN
Converts a regular maths expression into postfix/Reverse polish notation.
Infix: 12+3
Postfix: 12 3 +

Works for simple expressions like 12*(5+6) or 2*(3^3*2).
Using a binary tree would work wonders here, however, I couldn't figure out how to implement it properly and it scrambled my head quite a bit. Might try again at a later date.
